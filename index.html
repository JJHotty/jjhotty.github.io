            <h1 class="blurbh">Who I am...</h1>
            <p class="blurbp">Kia Ora, My name is Jas and this year I am studying at Dev Academy Aoteroa. <br>
            I live in the South Island of New Zealand and get to gaze at the most beautiful stary nights, get to enjoy the crisp fresh air, and love the outdoors. <br>
            <br><strong>Why am I studying this year?</strong> - I decided to study this year due to a realisation that life will never be suitable for a career change. Things like that aren't given, but taken through a ton of effort and hard work. <br>
            <br><strong>Why software Development?</strong> - I have always been a bit of a geek, but more than that I have always dabbled in software design (ever since I was about 12). I have used linux as my primary desktop for more than 10 years and it's definitely something I follow closely and am really passionate about.<br>
            <br><strong>What are your goals?</strong> - My goal for this year is to work overtime. To really put in all the time and effort that I can afford and score my first development job before the end of it. I'd also like to learn a few full development stacks. I have had my sights on the MERN stack. And a couple others.<br>
            <br><strong>What is this blog about?</strong> - This blog is an opportunity for me to put on paper a large list of things that I am doing, learning and all the times I've failed. And I can't wait to post them here and for others to get to laugh along while I explore and enjoy journey.<br>
            <br>Thanks for checking in! And feel free to explore.. </p>
