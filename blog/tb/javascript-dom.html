                <p class="blurbp">
                    <em><b>T</b>he DOM and Javascripts wild and wonderful relationship with CSS and HTML</em> <br><br>
                   
                   <b>T</b>he other day I wrote a few personal blog pages talking about the concepts that I was struggling with. And it seems that the jump from something like HTML or CSS where no logic is required, to Javascript where it's purely LOGIC - It's a big jump. So first of all. Don't stress out when things don't make sense. Things will take time to sink in, and your dreams may start to reflect the fact that you're mind is working through the concepts and breaking them down into the pieces that you do understand. <br><br>
                   <b>J</b>avascript has a really unique relationship to HTML and CSS. HTML appears as a skeleton and is simply made of the same material all over... It looks complicated only at first glance.. The parts that look complicated are it's rib cage, or maybe the neck. <br>
                   <b>C</b>SS is the clothing of the Skeleton. It's the hat on the head, or the scarf around the neck. It's also the color of each of those items and the exact alignment they have.. such as the hat on the head could be forwards, backwards or even upside down. And the scarf could be aligned centrally around the neck or could be wrapped from the left end or the right. <br>
                   <b>Javascript</b> Is different! It's all the tendons, muscles, organs, and skin. It's the living part. The part linked together through a maze of seemingly small attachments and linked in ways that are often hard to see. Javascript isn't HTML nor CSS- And it has very few similarities. The way it is written and it's function lend it to being completely different. But somehow so incredibly interlinked with HTML and CSS through the DOM.. 
                   <br><b>Y</b>ou could think of the DOM as being a separate function of CSS HTML and Javascript. But in reality it's the central point at which they all collide. Each connects through the DOM; which stands as the key component for allowing Javascript to manipulate the way the scarf is situated using it's muslces, and moving the skeleton around the same. 
                   
                   <br>
                   
                   <b>O</b>f course. Every analogy is a bad fit. No one could truly explain in a single blog post all the ways they all tie together. But using the Body to explain it's intricacy I think is a fitting attempt. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>I</b>n more detail. The DOM is a Document that get's generated by the code which makes up the website. HTML CSS etc. The unique thing about this document is that it originally represents what the HTML and CSS files display, but it can be manipulated using javascript. The method in which javascript changes the layout of an element on a page, or serves a darkmode when a button is pushed; is by DOM properties. These are pre-written objects that allow you to link to various parts of a webpage, different classes and Id's, and give access to various ways to manipulate the way things work. <br>
                  <!--Explain Control Flow and loops.--> <br>
                  <b>C</b>ontrol flow is the order in which the computer executes code. It's the order in which the computer reads the code and executes it. It's like a recipe. You have to follow the steps in order, or the cake won't come out right. And similarly to HTML and CSS- Javascript is read top to bottom.. But unique to Javascript is that Functions is that they aren't bound to the same restrictions within the flow. A function could be called anywhere within the code. <br>
                  <b>L</b>oops are a way of repeating a process. They are a way of telling the computer to do something over and over again. Just like you could write a single line of code to make a new number and print it out, you could also write a loop to make a new number and print it out 100 times.. Loops are also really useful for reading through an array/object and doing something to each item in the array/object. <br>
<br>            Objects are a container that can store information. They have a key- which serves as a label for the information they store. You could have an object named Joshua. And it could have a key called age: which would state 27. And maybe a key called skills: which would state piano playing.  <br><br>
<b>A</b>rrays are a little different to objects. They don't require a key, rather they are called using the index number. The first item in an array is index 0. The second is index 1. And so on.. This makes arrays the best for using loops. As loops natively use index numbers to call items. <br>
<b>F</b>unctions are a way of storing code. A working snippet of code that can be called anywhere within the form. They could be as small as testing what value something has, or as complex as calculating large amounts of data.. The cool things is that once a function is written, it can be called anywhere within the code as many times as wanted.<br><br>
