                    Git status<br>
                    Git log <br><br>
                    
                    <b>T</b>hese two commands keep track of where you are in the current timeline of the git process. 
                    It helps you see who last committed things, it also helps you see whether there are files that require committing. 
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Git diff<br>
                    Show unstaged differences since the last commit. <br><br>
                    
                    Git Checkout -- filename<br>
                    Git reset HEAD filenamegit reset --soft HEAD<br>

                    Git commit --amend -m “modify readme and add todo.txt”<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Git remote<br>
                    Remote is a way of pushing a locally saved file into GitHub. <br>
                    Cloning is a way of making a cloud saved file a local file. <br>
                    Cloning and branching<br>
                    Making a clone of an existing repository. <br>
                    Git clone URL. <br>
                    <br><br>
                     Git branch name. git branch  = see current location<br>
                    Git checkout branchname<br>
                    This switches us out of the main and into the new branch. <br>
                    <br><br>
                    Git checkout main/master to swap back to the main branch. <br><br>
                    
                     Git merge branchname<br><br>
                    
                    Git branch -d (delete) branchname to delete the branch. <br><br>
                    
                    Git checkout -b newbranchname (this creates a new branch and checkout’s to the new branch. As a shortcut<br><br></em>
                    
                    <b>A</b>fter creating 2 branches of my own trying to go through the whole process. Make new branch. Navigate to the branch. Make edits. Add, commit, push etc to the new branch. <br>
                    And then merge the branch with main. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>M</b>erging a branch requires that you be in the branch that you want to merge the new branch into. <br>
                    You need to be in the main branch to merge newbranch into it. <br><br>
                    
                    Git merge newbranch <br><br>
                    
                    <b>I</b>t took a few attempts as it kept saying that everything was updated. But didn’t give me the Vim nor a message about the changes made. <br>
                    But after I was in the main branch and did the same command. It worked giving me a highlight of all the changes made. <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <em>I understand how to clone a repo. <br>
                    I understand how to add, commit, and push to origin. I understand how to make branches and merge branches. <br>
                    I understand how to pull from a repo. <br>
                    The branches that I’ve been playing with are all local branches. <br>
                    There is such a thing as a remote branch. A remote branch can be made using <br><br>
                    
                    Git push origin newbranch<br><br>
                    
                    Git branch (shows local)<br>
                    Git branch -r (shows remote branches)<br>
                    <br><br>
                    To delete a remote branch <br>
                    Git push origin :newbranch<br>
                    <br><br>
                     To delete the local branch. <br>
                    Git branch -d newbranch (will check if there are commits pending)<br>
                    Or git branch -D newbranch (with admin- won’t check if commits are pending or not)<br>
                    git remote prune origin<br>
                    This removes any local repos that were linked to remote repos that don’t exist anymore. (As the project has moved on and remotes have been removed)<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Git tag (shows all tags)<br>
                    <br>
                    Git checkout v0.0.1 (move to previously tagged commit)<br>
                    <br>
                    Git tag -a v0.0.3 -m “version 0.0.3” (creates a new tag)<br>
                    <br>
                    Git push --tags (required to push the tags. - They don’t push without being done separately.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Rebase. <br>
                    There is a function called rebase that works similarly to a merge- But it doesn’t do It the traditional way. <br>
                    It starts off by fetching. <br>
                    Git fetch.<br>
                    <br>
                    And then you run git rebase <br></em>

                    New git tutorial. <br>
                    <b>A</b>s I was trying to continue through the course book. A different tutorial was suggested to be gone through. At first I was a little hesitant, but figure it might be really good to get more practice in and see it form a different perspective. 
                    
                    The start tutorial is talking about git init- basically setting git up to save a folder and getting all the files in place. <br>
                    
                    Git clone. Getting files from the GitHub repository and saving them locally. 
                    <br>
                    And git status. What’s currently going on. And is it set up correctly?<br>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>I</b> decided that actually I don’t need to continue. It was less detailed than the course I just did this morning. <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Reflection</p></b> <br>
            </p> <p class="blurbp">
                    <strong>W</strong>hat is git workflow?<br>
                    Git workflow is the steps to take to create repositories, save files to those repositories and to collect them from the saved repositories. <br><br>
                    
                    <strong>W</strong>hat did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?<br>
                    I have been exploring the concepts in git and GitHub for the last couple months, so a lot of the terminology sunk in really well, though there were a couple challenges with configuring ssh on my new computer and there were additional complications trying to do branching and comitting to a repository I hadn’t actually made on GitHub. And that is still a little unclear in my head at this point. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>I</strong>s there anything you’d do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration? <br>
                    I think I’d like to participate with others more. See what it’s actually like to have others performing changes and having to merge with conflicts on the repository. But overall I’m pretty happy with how things have gone. <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <strong>R</strong>eflection on Branch, Pull Merge.<br>
                    What is Main?<br>
                    Main is the root directory of a GitHub repo. It’s the main line and branches are made of of it. It’s also what people will clone to their devices to make local. <br><br>
                    
                    <strong>W</strong>hy create a branch? <br>
                    Branches allow us to keep the main line just well developed code without issues. And we can troubleshoot and work on the code in branches meaning the main line is just the working project. It also allows multiple people to work on various parts of the app without getting in each others way by moving or deleting code without it affecting the others work. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>D</strong>o the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?<br>
                    Not really. It makes sense how it was made up and why it works the way it does. Though I’m a little scared that I’ll forget the main commands to get it all setup. But I guess I can always come back and remind myself. <br><br>
