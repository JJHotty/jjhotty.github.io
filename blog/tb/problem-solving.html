                <p class="blurbp">
                  <b>O</b>kay, Well. This sprint I haven’t been fully there.
                  <br><br><b>I</b> started the sprint feeling really Lethargic, and empty. And every time I sat down to study I couldn’t give it more than 30 minutes before my concentration went from pretty average to terrible. I didn’t know what was going on, so I decided that I might need some rest. I mean. I have been working 4 days a week with every evening, and my entire weekends spent studying.. And maybe that was catching up to me. 
                  <br><br><b>W</b>hen I actually got to studying, I ended up struggling.. Things that I thought should work, didn’t and it was killing me. Simple problems I got blocked on- Missing letters, or things incorrectly written.. I did a getElementById.. Without the Document in front of it. Things like that really made my experience frustrating.. At least at first. I spent a lot of time learning to break the problem down into smaller pieces and work out if the smaller sections were accurately achieving what I needed them to. It just made the whole process a little bit more positive. Knowing that I was making progress and had smaller and smaller portions of the code left to debug. I learned that I need to take more care when typing. I have been a fairly fast typer for a long time with a 90% or so accuracy. Which I make up for being able to see the little red line and come back to change it, or fix it. But in the IDE. Words are often just accepted. Or there are multiple variables that I’m working with, and there have been times where I have tried to call a variable and either missed a letter. Frustrating and hard to find. But more frustratingly- Sometimes I have called a different variable all together. Spelling is fine. And you go through questioning your entire existence..
                  <br><br><b>I</b> also learned that it’s not a bad thing at all to throw my code through AI to see if portions are correct or not. I use chatGPT Playground. It’s a really neat setup where you can design your own assistant. And so I’ve given mine the name Trevor, and Trevor is a software developer by trade who is set to mentor me. He doesn’t provide code snippets unless explicitly asked, rather uses natural language to explain the coding principles. He likes to ask questions and intends on helping think around the concepts and things that might need to be thought out. Making Trevor this week was probably the most helpful thing I did. I didn’t have Trevor make all the answers for me, but really helped me nut down into some of the things that I didn’t understand. Like the various array methods and how to write them. I didn’t know that most of the methods were in-built functions and used a unique way of being called. They have a bracket where a parameter goes into and then a => arrow that leads to { the function body }. After learning about how the functions worked and the general syntax I made a lot faster progress and finally got through the Kata. 
                  <br><br><b>O</b>ne of the last Kata was an array method of join(). And it probably is one of the simpler ones, but after having spent 2 hours learning the other 3 methods. I was able to write it, test it.. and was right the very first time. Which was such a relief and made me feel like a freaking hero. I had reflected on the previous learning I had done and leaned on that to write it. 
                  <br><br><b>I</b> feel really confident when it comes to asking for help from peers or coaches, or even ai. I reflect often on the things that I learn. And at the end of the kata I ended up changing the way that I commit. My commit’s now are the thing that the commit achieves. As it should be. But has a brief sentence explaining something that I learned. And that was a really helpful way of reflection. I’m fairly good with google, and can often find a solution. But the hardest part with most solutions is that you can copy what they say and it works. But it doesn’t necessarily explain what’s happening or why it works. So I’ve ended up asking for help from people and AI more. I have found difficulty console.logging as I think some of the tests have been capturing them. And they aren’t spitting out as they should. But I feel pretty confident about how to use them when they work. I love trying things. The funny thing is that before I ask for help I generally try at least 5 different methods and then when I’ve found the answer- I like to see how close I got, and which one of the times was I the closest. A little challenge. And Pseudocode has been really helpful, except when something is completely unknown. Like I tried to break down how to use some of the array methods. But my actual understanding of how they worked was faulty. So nothing I did worked. 
                  <br><br><b>I</b> only get reluctant to help when I feel like I should be better than that.. Like. I just asked for help not even 5 minutes ago and now I’m stuck again. Or it’s related to something that I think should be simple, therefore if I’m asking for help. I’m really just going to bug the person.
