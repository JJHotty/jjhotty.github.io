                        <b>T</b>ime tracking with Toggl: Tonight- I learned about Toggl	and how to utilise the time tracking utility. I made a shortcut so that control, option and command 0 will start and pause the timer on the last known project. Letting me come and go easily without having to open the app and close the app and push gui interactive buttons. <br>
                        
                        <b>T</b>he next thing that I did was try and figure out the GitHub thing. 
                        Unfortunately I thought I had figured it out.. Till I tried to push something and it broke. I then went through the process of creating a new SSH key for the new Mac. And it took a little bit of searching to find the right commands to get it working. But after I figured it out- I connected the new SSH key to GitHub and tested it. It worked flawlessly. And I’m now all setup to start new projects on the new Mac an have git keeping track of it for me. 
                        <br>
                        <b>I</b> came to a new issue. I’m trying to push using a cloned repository and it’s telling me that I don’t own the rights to the location. And I can’t quite figure out if it’s just because it’s the test git project- Which might not be setup for push.. or maybe there’s still something that isn’t correctly configured. I plan on asking a question on the discord setup Chanel if I can’t figure it out in the next hour.

                        <b>P</b>roblem solving is a really common part of software development. Tools, code, thing both new and existing can cause issues or break, or do unexpected things. 
                        
                        Remember to break the problem down into smaller pieces. Line by line. Error messages. Etc. 
                        
                        Search... 
                        Search engines-- google etc. using tools like discord Chanel or slack, or reddit.

                        "I'm trying to. . ."
                        Describe what you think the issue is.
                        "I did A and expected B, but C happened."
                        Describe what you've already tried (so you don't get irrelevant answers).
                        "I've tried D, E, and F to fix it, but G happened."
                        If relevant - what language/frameworks are being used, or what operating system and version are you running on?
                        Post a nicely-formatted code block (more info on how to do this can be found in a pinned message in the foundations-help-desk channel), a screenshot of your browser (if relevant) and the error message.<br><br><b>T</b>he course started going through terminal commands. 
                        
                        <br><b>B</b>ecause I have experience with Linux and Mac terminal previously I decided to push myself to try the additional content. There was a link to a video by freecodecamp. Really explanative. But I didn’t look at the timestamps. The video is 5 hours long and I don’t have that kind of time to give it tonight. So I’m going to log off. But in saying that. I’m going to continue off 30:28 tomorrow. 
                        <br>
                        <b>S</b>o far I have learned what the terminal is what Unix and Linux and GNU are. I learned how to setup a terminal on the windows operating system and downloaded and installed iterm2 for macOS as suggested by the course. 
                        I then went through and tried to give it all the permissions it needed to do all that I wanted to do with it. As every new command was asking for permission. 
                        
                        I made a saved file of the list of command line cheat sheet that was linked to the dev academy page.
