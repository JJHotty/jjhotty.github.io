            <h1 class="blurbh">Emotional Intelligence..</h1>
                <p class="blurbp">
                    <b>T</b>hroughout history it was believed that a high IQ was 'the' indicator as to whether someone would be successful. But later they realised that when studying high IQ individuals only half of them actually became successful.. Meaning that Half of the other successful people didn't meet the metric that they had based. <br>
                    <b>I</b>t was later studied that there was a different type of intelligence, one that wasn't purely intellectual, but rather emotional. And a new test was formed. It was found that emotionally intelligent people were more regularly successful, but someone with both high IQ and EQ was even more likely to be successful. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>O</b>n top of that study came many more studies; studies performed and found that emotional intelligence is often more important than IQ alone. But they have also learned that IQ and EQ can be developed which wasn't originally understood. The old thought was that intelligent people were intelligent and those who were less intellectual would remain so. But through the study of neuroplacisity they have discovered that the brain is like a muscle and can be developed by doing logic puzzles and working on math skills. And Emotional intelligence can also be developed by intentionality; working on the way we listen, the way we communicate, the way we think etc..  <br>
                    <b>W</b>hat does it take to grow EQ for ourselves? : EQ is grown as we intentionally put effort into our thoughts, and our reactions. We need to assess the way we think, the way we react to things and we are allowing ourselves time to think through maybe a past reaction to someone telling us about their hard experiences. How did we react? How did we perceive their experience? Did it hurt them? Was it funny? Based on our understanding of their experience and based on our initial reactions; How did it go? And how would we like to react to something like that in the future? : On top of the way we react to others experiences, how are we reacting to our own? Are we blaming and being hard on ourselves? Are attempting to learn from the experience or shutting our feelings down in order to avoid the situation? 
                    <br>
                    <b>M</b>infulness is a practice similar to meditation- Where someone closes their eyes and just try to stay in the current moment. Accepting what is, and not getting stuck in the past or stressing about the future. 
                    <br><b>I</b>t's a great tool for allowing your mind time to think about things it's stuck on, and also assists with the learning process. It could also be a tool used for emotional intelligence giving you space to reflect on feelings of the current moment and thoughts.
                    <b></b>
