                    <strong> <br> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
                    <br><b>F</b>or a long time I have had the desire to be a software developer. And that desire has gone through phases of web development, game development, linux development and so many more... I think at the moment I have landed in a place of contented unrest. I know that I want to be in this field desparately, but I won't start where I want to end up. So my innitial goal is for me to land my first software development job in the web industry. Making web apps and webpages. But my final goal would be to have considerable contributions in a few major projects like the linux kernal, and to have a job doing something 'amazing'.. Like working for an entity like Samsung, or Sony- writing operating systems and making tools that benefit the world.<br>
 
                    <br>
                     <strong><br>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning<br></strong>
                     <b>I</b> have a number of strengths when it comes to studying, such as a stuborn determination and restlessness that enable me to study for hours on the same subject till I understand it or make enough headway to achieve a goal. But I also have weaknesses around study. I can really struggle to get started on something.. Sometimes it requires a lot of motivation to just 'start'. But once I've started that stubborness kicks in. I also can be really bad at asking for help- As I attempt to learn everything through sheer will. And sometimes that can really leave me in a hole for some time. <br>
                     <br> 
                     <strong><br>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
                     <br><b>I</b>'d like to observe and learn how to be a better communicator, and I'd like to learn how work well in a team. My current job is a sales front facing role- and I do that really well. But I've never really worked in an intellectual job, where you are talking and expressing thoughts and doing big brain-storms. It's not something I've tried. But it also sounds really foreign and a bit scary. So definitely really keen to learn a bit in this area.<br>
 <br>
                    <strong> <br>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong>
                 <ul class="blurbp">
                      <em><li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li></em>
                    
                      <em><li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li></em>
                 </ul> <br></p>
                 <p class="blurbp">
         <b>T</b>his past year I learned a lot about letting things snowball and about my desire to procrastinate. I’m making the commitment this year to work diligently, to keep a toggl timer on the things I’m working on, and to always respond to a message the same day (If at all possible). On top of things like messages and course work- I also commit to spending at least 30 minutes a day doing something relating to the course, whether looking over the coursework, coding myself, or looking at others projects and code. <br>I will also both learn to, and be quick to communicate when things are building up- With either my team or the facilitators so that I’m not being bogged down. <br>
         
 
                     <br><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
                     <br><b>M</b>y commitment to seeking help in a timely way is: I will use the discord group that’s been provided by the program often, and also use google as a progress through each of the sprints whenever I can. I also have a few friends who are also in the business and I would as them intentionally questions that I might need a more in depth response from, as that’s sometimes how my mind works. <br>
                    <br> <br><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
                     <br><b>I</b> have a few expectations from the facilitation team. <br><b>T</b>he first is I would like them to continue reaching out as they have been on the discord chat- Making themselves available and regularly hopping into chatrooms or just making their presence known. As this will be something I would definitely take them up on- If it suited my own schedule. <br><b>T</b>he second is I would like them to read over my content, to tell me where I’m doing something wrong, something isn’t working, or I may need to investigate something ie. a new layout tool. These things have already been done by the facilitation team.. But are so valuable, I’d love for them to continue. <br> 
                    
  <br><br><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong><br><b>M</b>y work week starts on Monday and ends on Thursday. I have a few weekly evening events that I attend. Such as a home group, a budgeting course, etc. <br>But I’m always free on the weekends- I make myself available on Friday, Saturday and Sundays and do all my study on these days.
