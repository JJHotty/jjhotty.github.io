                  <b>W</b>hat are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
                  Human Skills learning?<br />
                  <br /><b>T</b>he human skills section of the Dev Academy curriculum has been really key
                  for helping me recognize a range of things about both myself and my ego…
                  <br /><b>T</b>he first one is that I have both moments of a learning mindset and
                  moments of a closed mindset- And the closed mindset really set’s me back. That
                  has meant that I focus more on trying to stay calm and work on encouraging
                  myself to enjoy the moments of frustration, and when things are getting intense,
                  I’m more likely to take a break now- SO that I can come back to it in a better
                  headspace. <br /><b>T</b>he second on is that I have had really bad boundaries over the
                  last couple of years, and haven’t done the best keeping myself looked after.
                  Water, breaks, encouraging myself or taking time out to pause and reflect. These
                  are the things that have helped probably the most and really helped me in the
                  moments when I was unsure if this coding thing was even for me or not. Cause
                  there have definitely been moments of strong doubt, as I’ve sat there for hours
                  sitting at the little flashing cursor with a problem that I really truly cannot
                  solve. <br />
                  <b>T</b>he last thing that has been really vital is that I have had a really big ego.
                  And it’s been really humbling. Really humbling. But being humbled is a good
                  thing when you see really good things coming out of it and you see yourself
                  starting to excel in areas you weren’t expecting.
                  <br />
                  <br /><b>W</b>hat are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
                  programming? <br /><b>P</b>rogramming is a hard thing to learn.. And the more I try the
                  more of an extent that I understand that. You need a great community around you
                  for you to learn the most that you could. You need great communicators to teach
                  you and show you how to do it differently.The other thing that all of those
                  things come out of is Emotional Intelligence. An emotional intelligent person is
                  able to self reflect, but also understand the emotions of others and empathize
                  with their frustration or disillusionment.. And because of how important these
                  skills are for someone teaching others about code- They are important for
                  everyone coding- As we are always learning and teaching each other.
                  <br />
                  <br /><b>W</b>hat has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning? <br /><b>T</b>he
                  biggest surprise of all of them was learning about the growth mindset.. It truly
                  put to words something that had been niggling at the back of my mind for so
                  long.. And knowing that I’m capable of growing and learning even into later
                  adulthood really made me more relaxed and helped me truly jump into the
                  opportunity around me.
                  <br />
                  <br /><b>W</b>hat were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
                  <br />I think the one that put me most out of my comfort zone was the listening
                  and looping. I have really struggled in the past when I feel there is a lot of
                  pressure on me to memorise something. I’m definitely going to forget it or
                  stumble. So the idea of the listening and looping exercise really was a step
                  out. And in the same way. I hadn’t interacted with any of the people before the
                  exercise before I called them one on one to do it.. I ended up doing it with 3
                  people and it was really valuable!
                  <br />
                  <br /><b>W</b>hy do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
                  focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course? 
                  <br><b>A</b>s I
                  said above. The emotional intelligence of a person plays quite heavily into how
                  they learn, teach and communicate. And in software development you want to have
                  people that are teachable, can communicate effectively for different people and
                  different levels of people— Those who are in development backgrounds and those
                  who aren’t.
                  <br />
                  <br /><b>D</b>oes the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
                  waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
                  instead? Justify your answer. <br /><b>D</b>efinitely not. I think it’s really helped
                  put words to concepts that we couldn’t have learned without it being said. And
                  helps push us to be better people, rather than better nerds. (I’m definitely a
                  nerd).
