What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
Human Skills learning?<br />
<br />The human skills section of the Dev Academy curriculum has been really key
for helping me recognize a range of things about both myself and my ego…
<br />The first one is that I have both moments of a learning mindset and
moments of a closed mindset- And the closed mindset really set’s me back. That
has meant that I focus more on trying to stay calm and work on encouraging
myself to enjoy the moments of frustration, and when things are getting intense,
I’m more likely to take a break now- SO that I can come back to it in a better
headspace. <br />The second on is that I have had really bad boundaries over the
last couple of years, and haven’t done the best keeping myself looked after.
Water, breaks, encouraging myself or taking time out to pause and reflect. These
are the things that have helped probably the most and really helped me in the
moments when I was unsure if this coding thing was even for me or not. Cause
there have definitely been moments of strong doubt, as I’ve sat there for hours
sitting at the little flashing cursor with a problem that I really truly cannot
solve. <br />
The last thing that has been really vital is that I have had a really big ego.
And it’s been really humbling. Really humbling. But being humbled is a good
thing when you see really good things coming out of it and you see yourself
starting to excel in areas you weren’t expecting.
<br />
<br />What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
programming? <br />Programming is a hard thing to learn.. And the more I try the
more of an extent that I understand that. You need a great community around you
for you to learn the most that you could. You need great communicators to teach
you and show you how to do it differently.The other thing that all of those
things come out of is Emotional Intelligence. An emotional intelligent person is
able to self reflect, but also understand the emotions of others and empathize
with their frustration or disillusionment.. And because of how important these
skills are for someone teaching others about code- They are important for
everyone coding- As we are always learning and teaching each other.
<br />
<br />What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning? <br />The
biggest surprise of all of them was learning about the growth mindset.. It truly
put to words something that had been niggling at the back of my mind for so
long.. And knowing that I’m capable of growing and learning even into later
adulthood really made me more relaxed and helped me truly jump into the
opportunity around me.
<br />
<br />What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
<br />I think the one that put me most out of my comfort zone was the listening
and looping. I have really struggled in the past when I feel there is a lot of
pressure on me to memorise something. I’m definitely going to forget it or
stumble. So the idea of the listening and looping exercise really was a step
out. And in the same way. I hadn’t interacted with any of the people before the
exercise before I called them one on one to do it.. I ended up doing it with 3
people and it was really valuable!
<br />
<br />Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course? As I
said above. The emotional intelligence of a person plays quite heavily into how
they learn, teach and communicate. And in software development you want to have
people that are teachable, can communicate effectively for different people and
different levels of people— Those who are in development backgrounds and those
who aren’t.
<br />
<br />Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
instead? Justify your answer. <br />Definitely not. I think it’s really helped
put words to concepts that we couldn’t have learned without it being said. And
helps push us to be better people, rather than better nerds. (I’m definitely a
nerd).
