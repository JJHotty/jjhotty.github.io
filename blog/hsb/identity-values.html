                <p class="blurbp">
                    <strong> Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong>
                    <br>A past work-mate of mine made some sketchy decisions that was putting others at risk. I really appreciated them as a person, but their decisions if something ever went wrong- could have  had really awful ramifications.. I struggled with the decision to pass it up to our manager, because I felt like I didn't want to be responsible for them getting fired, but I also knew that someone could get hurt from their actions. I thought for a couple weeks and then went to our boss. The decision was a hard one to make, but I'm really glad that I had made it. It cleared my conscience almost immediately, and also put action to something that wasn't quite going right. And the end result wasn’t that my workmate was fired, but were given feedback and were offered the opportunity to grow.  <br>
                    <br> 
                    <strong><br>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong>
                    <br>I am a Pakeha- grew up in the city of Auckland in a home that could be occasionally turbulent. I had a narcissistic parent and that defined a major part of my upbringing. (So though I recognise it doesn’t answer the question perfectly, it is where I was most influenced and set the culture around me). <br>I eventually sought out a community that was more mentally affirming. I ended up working and living at a residential camp as a staff member and worked through my childhood. I was surrounded by people who loved celebration, could be vulnerable and loved hard-core sports. ie. Rock climbing, caving.. etc. <br>I was able to grow and learn to move on- Accepting the things I cannot control, and working on the things and parts of myself that I could. Now I put a lot of value in vulnerability, positivity, and encouragement. And I work really hard to surround myself with individuals who share similar values. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><br>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong>
                    <br>A few years ago I had the opportunity to do the Gallup strengths finder test. And then had a mentor sit down with me and go through each of the strengths - Highlighting each of them and how they tie into each other, but also how each of them can be linked to a weakness that needs to be pruned and worked on. <br>
                    My top 5 strengths are: <br>
                    <div class="flxitm">
                    <ul class="blurbp">
                    <li>Restorative- Adept problem solving skills</li>
                    <br><li>Learner- A great desire to learn and a want to continuously improve </li>
                    <br><li>Input- A craving to dive deeper and know more</li>
                    <br><li>Analytical- Talented in searching for reasons and causes</li>
                    <br><li>Deliberative- Take care in making decisions and choices</li>
                    </ul></div>
                    <p class="blurbp">
                    These strengths will be a great support to me as I endeavour to learn software development and put in the hard work over this year. Each link closely to my learning style. Which will requires some attention put into- ie. how much am I getting stuck on the causality of a specific function, how long is it taking me to make a decision- Does this decision need to be thought out as much as I’m giving it? Etc. <br>
                    But I’m excited to learn this year. <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong>
                    <br> When I think about the limitations of my learning and career development- I think I’ve actually been super blessed. Though a limitation might be- That I never finished year 13, which in turn meant that university wasn’t immediately available. This meant that I had to find a job- And with that I developed a work ethic that has helped my learning a career developments since. But I recognise that I don’t have the same education that a lot of others do, nor the same context surrounding assignments and paper related learning. <br>
                    <br><br><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.    </strong>
                    <br>I had been at my job for a whole year up to this point.. Diligently figuring out the processes, learning new methods and putting in a lot of effort to catch up on the things that the last guy had let go, or missed. <br>
                    I eventually have a conversation with my manager and they hired someone to come on the team with me, and I’ll be in charge of their onboarding. <br>
                    I took the role really seriously and at the start I let them just observe and ask questions- I figured this would be a great way to get them up to speed. <br>
                    Weeks went by and they didn’t ask any questions, they didn’t seem to have the same work ethic that I was expecting and it caught me off guard. <br>I decided to throw them into the deep end and gave them certain tasks- I remained there as a safety net, but figured they must have a different learning style than me. <br>On the first one they required a step in- that’s all good.. But it started becoming the norm. They would do part of the job, get me to step in and I’d have to do the rest. <br>
                    I eventually had a sit down with them and talked them through my side of the situation- I feel like I’ve tried to make your onboarding the best ever and tried to make myself available, but now I just feel like you aren’t making any progress towards learning it to do it for yourself. <br>
                    This was the part I wish I had done right at the beginning! Up to this point I had guessed what their learning style was, I had guessed how they were and how much they had taken on, I had internalised plans for myself and never consulted the other party once. <br>
                    After talking with them, we collectively made a plan and I made them the leading party on their learning and onboarding. <br>
                    A month later they were thriving in the job and I was feeling so much better!<br>
                    If the same situation came up again, I would most definitely sit down with the other party and discuss openly about what needs to be done, and ask for their input while putting the plan together. And I would most definitely communicate sooner rather than later when feeling like things aren’t going to plan or that we aren’t seeing eye to eye.
